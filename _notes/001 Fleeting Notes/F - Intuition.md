# Topic/Concept/Idea

Intuition is the ability to understand or feel something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning.

# Thoughts/Questions

- Is one's intuition determined by the type of person they are? e.g. in a vacuum, will the intuition of an anxious person differ from that of a confident person?
