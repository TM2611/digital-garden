What is Emotional Intelligence?

"Refers to an individual's ability to perceive, use, understand, and manage their own emotions and those of others. Involves several specific skills:

- Emotional awareness, or the ability to identify and name one's own emotions.
- The ability to harness those emotions and apply them to tasks like thinking and problem-solving.
- Emotion regulation - the ability to manage emotions, which includes regulating one's own emotions when necessary and helping others to do the same."
