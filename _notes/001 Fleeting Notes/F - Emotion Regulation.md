What is Emotion Regulation?

"Subset of [[F - Emotional Intelligence]], refers to the ability to manage and respond to an emotional experience in a socially acceptable and flexible manner. Emotion regulation involves:

- The capacity to resist impulsive behaviours related to intense emotions.
- The ability to calm oneself down when upset or angry.
- The ability to cheer oneself up when feeling down.
- Being able to focus on a task despite emotional distractions.

In essence, emotion regulation is a crucial part of emotional intelligence. It is the practical application of understanding and managing emotions. Emotional intelligence, on the other hand, is broader, encapsulating not only the management and understanding of one's own emotions but also the ability to understand and respond to the emotions of others."
