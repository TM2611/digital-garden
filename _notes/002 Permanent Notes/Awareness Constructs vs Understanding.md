# Topic/Concept/Idea

When we add qualifiers like "emotional" or "environmental" to [[Awareness]], we are often talking about a more specialised, multi-layered form of awareness that incorporate understanding as a critical component. These terms don't just refer to the initial recognition; they encompass a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the subject.

In these specialised constructs, "awareness" isn't just the starting point; it's a more comprehensive term that includes several layers:

- **Recognition**: Initial acknowledgement of a phenomenon (e.g., "I am feeling something" or "There is a lot of litter here").
- **Identification**: Labelling or naming what you've recognised (e.g., "I am feeling anxious" or "This area has a pollution problem").
- **Understanding**: Delving into the 'why' and 'how' of the phenomenon (e.g., "I am anxious because of an upcoming test" or "This area is polluted due to industrial waste").
