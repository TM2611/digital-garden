[[Awareness vs Understanding]] explores the idea that awareness precedes understanding. If this is the case, you may ask yourself "if awareness precedes understanding, how can understanding your emotions be apart of emotional awareness?". however to get this, it is best to picture the relationship between emotional awareness and understanding as a linear scale.

**Basic emotional awareness --> Deeper emotional awareness --> Understanding**

**Basic Emotional Awareness**: This is the initial recognition that one is experiencing an emotion. For instance, realising, "I'm feeling something strong right now."

**Deeper Emotional Awareness**: Beyond just recognising that one has an emotion, it's identifying and naming that emotion. For instance, "I'm feeling anxious."

**Understanding**: This delves into the causes, triggers, and implications of that emotion. For instance, "I'm feeling anxious because I have an important meeting tomorrow, and I'm worried about how it will go."

The term 'emotional awareness' encompasses both the **Basic Emotional Awareness** and **Deeper Emotional Awareness**. The potential confusion arises due to the use of the phrase 'understanding your emotions' to describe identifying and naming your emotions - which is a part of **Deeper Emotional Awareness** on the above scale. However, as with awareness generally, true understanding comes after emotional awareness. In this scenario "I'm feeling anxious" would indicate emotional awareness, whereas understanding comes through the processing of this emotion to determine the "why" or "how".
