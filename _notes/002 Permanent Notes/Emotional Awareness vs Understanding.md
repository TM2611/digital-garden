# Topic/Concept/Idea

When we narrow our focus to [[F - Emotional Awareness]], the relationship between awareness and understanding becomes more nuanced. In general terms, awareness often precedes understanding (e.g. you become aware of a new concept before you understand it). However, when discussing emotional awareness as a specific psychological construct,  the term is often used to encompass a spectrum of emotional recognition, identification, and understanding. Understanding is seen as an integral part of emotional awareness, not a subsequent stage.
