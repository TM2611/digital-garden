There are many different types of awareness. However awareness, put simply, is the conscious perception or recognition of facts, feelings, and surroundings. Awareness has two key aspects or ways of looking at it- knowledge and perception. Take emotional awareness for example. The 'perception' aspect is that emotional awareness involves perceiving and recognising feelings and emotions. This can manifest as a gut feeling or physical sensations (like a racing heart or sweaty palms) for example. The 'knowledge' aspect is that emotional awareness also entails knowing what these emotions signify and how they influence thoughts and behaviours. 

People most commonly refer to the perception aspect of awareness, however knowledge-based awareness should also be considered. Knowledge-based awareness (KBA) refers to a conscious awareness that stems from accumulated information, learning, and comprehension, rather than from sensory perception or intuition. Knowledge is often associated with understanding, and so naturally KBA tends to be referred to as understanding - but to me awareness and understanding are two related but separate entities.
