# Topic/Concept/Idea

Awareness refers to the recognition or perception of information, feelings, and surroundings. It can manifest in two distinct but parallel forms: one based on direct sensory experience or perception, and the other grounded in acquired knowledge. Each form can exist independently, and neither automatically leads to a understanding of the subject at hand. An example of each of the two forms of awareness can be seen below.

1. Seeing rubbish scattered along a beach or feeling heat on a particularly warm day.
2. Hearing about the existence of climate change or pollution on the news, but not knowing how or why these issues are interconnected or what can be done about them.

Both of these scenarios illustrate being aware of environmental issues without necessarily understanding broader implications. Awareness and understanding are two related but separate entities. See [[Awareness vs Understanding]] for a deeper look into the difference between the two.
