# Topic/Concept/Idea

Awareness serves as the initial step in the process of understanding. To help understand the relationship between the two you can, generally, envision awareness as existing on a spectrum that ranges from simple perception or fundamental information at one end to deep understanding at the other.

Consider the two following situations:

1. Seeing a flash of movement in the corner of your eye, but not catching what exactly it was
2. Recognising that bees have a vital function in pollination and the ecosystem, but no knowing why

Both situations are examples of awareness. The first illustrates the sensory facet of awareness, while the second highlights the informational or knowledge-based facet. However, the latter should also highlight the difference between awareness and understanding. While there's recognition of bees' significance in the ecosystem, there isn't an understanding of it as the deeper rationale or "why" remains unknown.

You may think "Well, could i not just say 'I understand that bees have a vital function in the ecosystem' ". While you could, depending on your definition and interpretation of understanding, I tend to subscribe to the idea that awareness precedes understanding; it's the initial recognition or acknowledgement, whereas understanding delves deeper into the "why" or "how" of a concept. 

Consider the statements "I am aware of your feelings regarding the decision." and "I understand your feelings regarding the decision. Although both statements are similar and are often used interchangeably, there is a slight distinction between the two. With "I am aware of ..."  you are acknowledging the fact that someone is upset. It's a recognition of their emotional state. "I understand that..." however,  goes a step further implying that you not only recognise their emotional state but also comprehend or empathise with the reasons or sentiments behind that state. 

One interesting point to consider is that although awareness precedes understanding, in some cases, understanding can actually enhance awareness. For instance, a doctor's understanding of symptoms and conditions can make them much more aware of early signs of illness, often catching things that they would otherwise miss without this understanding.

Note that there is an extra layer of complexity within the context of the relationship between understanding and specialised awareness constructs (e.g., Emotional Awareness, Environmental Awareness). See [[Awareness Constructs vs Understanding]].
