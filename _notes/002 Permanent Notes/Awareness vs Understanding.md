# Topic/Concept/Idea

 Consider the two following situations:

1. Seeing a flash of movement in the corner of your eye, but not catching what exactly it was
2. Recognizing that bees have a vital function in pollination and the ecosystem, but no knowing why

Both of the examples above are examples of awareness, the first being an example of the perception aspect and the second being an example of the knowledge aspect. The second example, however, should serve as a distinction between Awareness and understanding. Although there is an awareness of the role bees play in pollination and the ecosystem, there isn't an understanding of it. Awareness often precedes understanding; it's the initial recognition or acknowledgment, whereas understanding delves deeper into the "why" or "how" of a concept.
