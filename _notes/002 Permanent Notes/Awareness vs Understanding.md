# Topic/Concept/Idea

Consider the two following situations:

1. Seeing a flash of movement in the corner of your eye, but not catching what exactly it was
2. Recognising that bees have a vital function in pollination and the ecosystem, but no knowing why

Both of the examples above are examples of awareness, the first being an example of the perception aspect and the second being an example of the knowledge aspect. The second example, however, should serve as a distinction between awareness and understanding. Although there is an awareness of the role bees play the ecosystem, there isn't an understanding of it. 

You may think "Well, could i not just say 'I understand that bees have a vital function in the ecosystem' ". While you could, depending on your definition and interpretation of understanding, I tend to subscribe to the idea that awareness precedes understanding; it's the initial recognition or acknowledgement, whereas understanding delves deeper into the "why" or "how" of a concept. 

Consider the statements "I am aware of your feelings regarding the decision." and "I understand your feelings regarding the decision. Although both statements are similar and are often used interchangeably, there is a slight distinction between the two. With "I am aware of ..."  you are acknowledging the fact that someone is upset. It's a recognition of their emotional state. "I understand that..." however,  goes a step further implying that you not only recognise their emotional state but also comprehend or empathise with the reasons or sentiments behind that state. However there is an extra layer of complexity within the context of the relationship between emotional awareness and understanding see [[Emotional Awareness vs Understanding]].

One final observation and interesting point to consider is that, in some cases, understanding can actually enhance awareness. For instance, if someone understands the patterns of how certain triggers lead to specific emotions in them, they might become more quickly aware when such emotions arise in response to those triggers.
